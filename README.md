# A multi-step sign up process

## Objective

Using React/Typscript, design and build a mostly _(it prints to console at the end instead of sending an API call)_ functional multi-step sign up process flow.

You're welcome to take as long as you like but the idea is for this challenge to take no more than a few hours.

## Requirements

- [ ] The form needs to ask the user for the following information and validate it:
   - email
   - password
   - name
   - organisation name
   - organisation size
   - organisation use case/category
   - user role
   - initial team members to invite
   - One of three different pricing plan options
   - accepting terms and conditions
   - adding to mailing list
- [ ] The user is shown a summary of their choices before submitting
- [ ] The form should respect the browsers light/dark preference.
- [ ] Form prints to the console when submitting.

The specifics are up to you to demonstrate your decision making.
